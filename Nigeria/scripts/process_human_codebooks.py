Process the human-coded codebooks (Content + Audience) end to end.

Inputs (filled-in coder files from the team):
    ~/Downloads/Content Analysis Codebooks/        (6 files, 33-col schema)
    ~/Downloads/Audience Analysis Codebooks/       (6 files, 41-col schema)

For each set, the script:
1. Reads every coder's two sheets ("Nigeria" and "Kenya").
2. Cleans every cell — trim whitespace, drop trailing periods, normalize
   unicode quotes, map known short-forms and typos back to the canonical
   enum values, and tokenize multi-select cells using longest-enum-match
   so that options legitimately containing commas (e.g.
   "Gender issues, e.g. equality") are not split apart.
3. Writes the cleaned per-coder files into a "<set> - cleaned/" subfolder.
4. Builds a master compiled workbook:
       Codebooks/Human Codebooks/Master Human <Set> Codebook.xlsx
   Each unique (country, Item ID) appears exactly once. For items coded by
   multiple coders ("overlap" items: 15 doubles + 5 sextuples per country),
   the final row uses the modal answer per field across coders.
5. Builds a manager-facing recoding report:
       Codebooks/Human Codebooks/Recoding Needed - <Set>.xlsx
   listing every cell that needs human attention, with severity, the
   originating coder, country, item ID, and a one-line description.

Coder identity is taken from the filename (after the last " - "), not the
A/B/C/D/E/F prefix, because the prefix-to-name mapping differs between
Content (D=Selene, E=Rohan) and Audience (D=Rohan, E=Selene).
